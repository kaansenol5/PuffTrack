# PuffTrack

PuffTrack is a mobile app designed to help users track their vaping habits, monitor puff frequency, and gain insights into their usage patterns. Initially developed as a paid subscription-based app, it is now open source and no longer actively maintained.
PuffTrack is still available on the App Store, but no new updates or features are planned.
## Features
- **Puff Tracking**: Logs and analyzes vaping sessions with timestamps.
- **Financial Insights**: Estimates money spent and saved over time.
- **Withdrawal Tracker**: Assists users in reducing or quitting vaping.
- **Social Features**: Users could add friends and compare stats (optional).
- **Notifications & Insights**: Provided daily reminders and tracking insights.

## Why Open Source?
Development on PuffTrack has been discontinued, but the source code is available for anyone who wants to fork, modify, or build upon it.
I can remove it from the store if someone really wants to pick it up and do stuff. but that sounds unlikely
